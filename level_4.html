    <br><h3><p>Level 04 the fifth level of this reality is a series of underground bridges that look very old and broken down with white yellowish tiles and moss and ivy growing in some of the bridges. </p>
    <p>There are some central points on this level when 2 or 4 bridges meet, whitch are circular areas with a pilar in the middle in some rare ocasions the pilar can have an elevator on it. </p>
    <p>The level contains some weird effects like the depper you go into the level it starts decaying and getting more and more unstayble, another thing on this level is that is impossible to map due to it's unknown size and due to an effect that no matter what direction you go the place you will end up in
will be completly random for exemple: if you take right and go on a straigth line you migth go left or backwards instead. </p>
    <p>The entities present here are entites 03, 05, 09, 11 and 14.</p>
    
    <br><p> Entrance: Level 1</p>
