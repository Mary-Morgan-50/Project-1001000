  <h3><br><p>The eyes are an entity than can be very dangerous or present no Treath</p>
  <p>depending on the factor of other hostaile entities being present or not;</p>
  <p>if a hostaile entity is passing by and the eyes see you it will be awere of your </p> 
  <p>presence, when that happenss it is adviced to RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN!</p>
  <p>But if no hostaile entities are present you should be fine, the best way to</p>
  <p>avoid them is not get in its line of sigth or to confuse them with an</p>
  <p>object if necessary as they detect any movement of something that isn't an</p>
  <p>entity, so things like a door moving, a object being trowed, etc.</p></h3>
