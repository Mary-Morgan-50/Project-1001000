  <p>that disguise them selfs as elevators in order to trick survivors so we</p>
  <p>advice to NOT GO NEAR ANY ELEVATOR ON THIS REALITY!</p>
  <p>Execpt for cases that you know for sure the elevator is not this entity like</p> 
  <p>the case in level 4.</p>
  <p>Once they have a survivor inside them close it's doors and they will drop</p> 
  <p>down what happens next is unsure all we know is that after that you won't</p> 
  <p>be alive anymore.</p></h3>
