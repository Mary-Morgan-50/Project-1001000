    <p>The entities present on this level are entites 1,5,8,9,11,14,21,22. </p>
    <p>Reserchers have found that the resson there are so many entities on this level is likely due to this lab being used to experement on them, probably on the expriment rooms because they have broken cages everywhere and seem to be more run down then the rest of the lab, there for this place was likely to have been abonded given to a breakout.</p>
